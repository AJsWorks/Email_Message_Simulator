# Email_Message_Simulator
This Python program simulates email messages using classes and methods. It demonstrates the application of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program manages email messages in a systematic and modular way using OOP, making maintenance and extensibility simpler.
It is divided into two classes called "Email" and "Inbox", each of which has a set of methods for dealing with and managing email messages.

## Features
* Email Class: This class allows you to create and manage email objects that have attributes like the sender's email address, the subject line, and the email's contents. You have the option of marking emails as read or spam.
* Inbox Class: This class provides many functionalities for organizing and managing emails, such as adding new emails, listing messages from a certain sender, and more. It is designed to store email objects.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run the email.py file
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program
